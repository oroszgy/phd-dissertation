  abstract = {The first steps of processing clinical documents are structuring and normalization. In this paper we demonstrate how we compensate the lack of any structure in the raw data by transforming simple formatting features automatically to structural units. Then we developed an algorithm to separate running text from tabular and numerical data. Finally we generated correcting suggestions for word forms recognized to be incorrect. Some evaluation results are also provided for using the system as automatically correcting input texts 
by choosing the best possible suggestion from the generated list. Our method is based on the statistical characteristics of our Hungarian clinical data set and on the HUMor Hungarian morphological analyzer. The conclusions claim that our algorithm is not able to correct 
all mistakes by itself, but is a very powerful tool to help manually correcting Hungarian medical texts in order to produce a correct text 
corpus of such a domain.},

The tagger is implemented in Java and has a permissive LGPL license thus it is easy to integrate and modify. It is fast to train and use while having an accuracy on par with slow to train Maximum Entropy or Conditional Random Field based taggers. 
Full integration with morphology and an incremental training feature make it suited for integration in web based applications. 
We show that the integration with morphology boosts our tool's accuracy in every respect -- especially in full morphological disambiguation -- when used for morphologically complex agglutinating languages. 
We evaluate PurePos on Hungarian data demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in terms of tagging precision and accuracy of full morphological analysis.},

Since part-of-speech tagging is a fundamental part of any text processing chain, tagging tasks must be performed with high accuracy. 
While there are numerous studies on tagging medical English, we are not aware of any previous research examining the same field for Hungarian.
This paper presents methods and resources which can be used for annotating medical Hungarian and investigates their application to tagging clinical records. 
Our research relies on a baseline setting, whose performance was improved incrementally by eliminating its most common errors. The extension of the lexicon used raised the overall accuracy significantly, while other domain adaptation methods were only partially successful. 
The presented enhancements corrected almost half of the errors. However, further analysis of errors suggest that abbreviations should be handled at a higher level of processing.},

method for calculating MLU is to use the CLAN toolkit, which includes
modules that enable the measurement of utterance length in morphemes.
However, these methods are based on rules which are only available
for just a few languages not involving Hungarian. Therefore, in order
to automatically analyze and measure Hungarian transcripts adequate
methods need to be developed. In this paper we describe a new toolkit
which is able to estimate MLU counts (in morphemes) while providing
morphosyntactic tagging as well. Its components are based on existing
resources; however, many of them were adapted to the language of the
transcripts. The tool-chain performs the annotation task with a high pre

With utilizing these gains, our system outperforms the HMM-based ones. In order to handle the unknown words, a suffix-tree based guesser was integrated into HuLaPos2. To demonstrate the performance of our system it was compared with several systems in different languages and PoS tag sets.
