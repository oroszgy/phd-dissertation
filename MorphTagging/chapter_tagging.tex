\section{Motivation}

This chapter draws on research in morphological tagging of languages which are so-called less-resourced (those that lack linguistic resources e.g. manually annotated corpora).
Although several attempts have been made on developing part-of-speech tagging algorithms since the 1960’s (e.g.~\cite{}), those were focusing mainly on English.
Further on, in contrast to the consensus of NLP scientist that these studies resulted in methods that commonly accepted as solutions to the problem (~\cite{}), there are still many open questions.
Most of the previous work only concentrate on increasing the accuracy of taggers on news text, many other problems (such as domain adaptation of taggers) are still barely touched.
However, there has been an increasing interest recently on processing texts in less-resourced languages, which are usually morphologically rich.
Most of them are inflectional or agglutinative which pose new challenges to researchers.
This work will give an account of agglutinating languages by investigating the case of Hungarian.

The data sparseness issue of the tagging task is remarkable for morphologically rich languages.
If we compare (cf.~\cite{Oravecz}) agglutinative languages like Hungarian or Finnish with English in terms of the coverage of vocabulary by a corpus of a given size, we find that although there are a lot more different word forms in the corpus, these still cover a much smaller percentage of possible word forms of the lemmata in the corpus than in the case of English.
On the one hand, a 10 million word English corpus has less than 100,000 different word forms~\cite{}, a corpus of the same size for Finnish or Hungarian contains well over 800,000.
On the other hand, while an open class English word has about 4--6 different inflected forms, it has several hundred or thousand different productively suffixed forms in agglutinative languages.
Moreover, there are much more different possible morphosyntactic tags in the case of these languages (cf.~\cite{}) than in English (several thousand vs. a few dozen).
Thus the problem is threefold:

\begin{itemize}
  \item an overwhelming majority of possible word forms of lemmata occurring in the corpus is totally absent,
  \item word forms that do occur in the corpus have much fewer occurrences, and
  \item there are also much fewer examples of tag sequences, what is more, many tags may not occur in the corpus at all.
\end{itemize}
Another issue for morphologically rich languages is that tagging words with only their part-of-speech is insufficient.
On one hand, it is due to the fact that the complex morphosyntactic features carried by the inflectional morphemes could not be represented in such small tagsets that have less than a hundred different labels.
On the other hand, morphosyntactic tagging is still just a subtask of the full morphological disambiguation.
In addition to a full morphosyntactic tag, the lemma of each word also needs to be identified.
Although several studies have revealed that dictionary- or rule-based lemmatization/stemming methods yields acceptable results~\cite{} for morphologically not very rich languages like English, ambiguity is present in lemmatization for highly inflectional and agglutinative languages~\cite{Hajic,Szlovénok,Morfette}.
Therefore, the identification of the correct lemma is a challenging task.
Yet, most of the currently available taggers only concentrate on determining the morphological tag but not the lemma, thus doing just half of the job.

Another key point is the case of resource-scarce languages where the annotated corpora available is limited.
Pursuing this further, to create a morphologically annotated corpus for such a language, an iterative workflow is a feasible approach:

\begin{itemize}
  \item first, a very small subset of the corpus is disambiguated manually,
  \item then a tagger is trained on this subset,
  \item after that, another subset of the corpus is tagged automatically and corrected manually, yielding a new, bigger training corpus and this process is repeated. 
\end{itemize}
For this process to be in fact feasible, a high accuracy tagger is needed which performs well even when just a small amount of training data is available. 

In this chapter, approaches on developing effective morphological tagging algorithms is presented.
First, I review common tagging and lemmatization methods, then introduce  a hybrid approach to the full.
It is being show, that the methodology presented achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, even more performs well when only a limited training data is available.
In section \ref{} a tagger combination method is presented which is built on top of two systems raising the ceiling of the tagging accuracy.
Finally, new scientific results are summed up by declaring theses.
